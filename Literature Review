## Altman, 1968
Financial ratios, discriminant analysis and the prediction of corporate bankruptcy

Obj : attempt an assessment of the quality of ratio analysis as an analytical technique

Historically, find the ratio that explains the defaultness but every study has its preferred ratio.

Altman: combination of ratios, which ratios ? which weights ? 
Statistical method : Multiple discriminant analysis $\approx$ LDA with multiple groups

Stratification of the firms by industry and size
Withdraw the small companies and the very large

Z = .012X1 + .014X2 + .033X3 + .006X4 + .999X5
where X1 = Working capital/Total assets $\rightarrow$ measure of the net liquid assets of the firm relative to the total capitalization (often in studies, eg : Merwin)
Working capital = current asset - current liabilities
X2 = Retained Earnings/Total assets $\rightarrow$ cumulative profitability over time ; young company will have a small re/ta ratio (no time to have cumulated a lot of profits)
X3 = Earnings before interest and taxes/Total assets $\rightarrow$ measure of the true productivity of the company / profitability of a firm
X4 = Market value equity/Book value of total debt $\rigtarrow$ how much the firm's assets can decline in value before the the company becomes insolvent + add a market value that other studies don't have (more efficient than Net worth / Total debt)
X5 = Sales/Total assets $\rightarrow$ measure of management's capability in dealing with competitive conditions ; not significant alone but it is with the other ratios
Z = Overall Index ; greater firm's bankruptcy potential = lower discriminant score (Z)

Contribution of the variable (in order) : X3, X5, X4, X2, X1
Importance of the fifth ratio, 2nd in the importance + negative information (Cochran, more important to have a negative correlation than one more positive one)

MDA model : extremely correct in the initial model : 33 firms of each group (bankrupcy and no bankruptcy), data one financial statement prior to bankruptcy (?) (95% correctly specified) 
2nd model : 2 years before bankruptcy, 72% of accuracy 
Test ok up to 5 years before bankruptcy

Limits: sample bias and search bias
Model with a new set (21 bankrupt companies) : better accuracy than the first model (96%) $\rightarrow$ upward bias not in the test set
New dataset, close to the first group of companies (negative profit 2/3 years before the bankrupt), good result ; for misclassification, can be explained by values of Z in a "gray area" (all misclassified companies are have Z score between 1.81 and 2.67)

If 2 to 5 years, less reliable prediction of bankruptcy

Application: find the value of Z that represents a cut-off point
Z > 2.99, non-bankruptcy (very certain)
Z < 1.81, all bankrupt
In between, zone of ignorance (pb of misclassification)
Threshold value: 2.675 (chosen by looking at the misclassified companies, $\approx$ median)

- MDA model can not be used for credit evaluation as it does not take important variables for this sector (purpose of the loan, its maturity, security involved, deposity status...)
- internal control considerations: the criteria can be used to anticipate difficulties
